# React-Hooks


1) useState hook
Hooks Avoid The whole confusion regarding the this keyword

Call Hooks at the top level, DOnt cal loops inside loops or in conditions.

Call Hooks from only React Functions and not just any random JS function.

useState hook lets you add state to your functional component

In class component, state needs to be an object but it is not so in the Functional component

useState returns a state ( element 1 ) as well as state setter function ( element 2 )

Make sure to spread the state function
