# React-Hooks

2) useEffect hook
combining the two sideffects for the same piece fo code i.e. same code in componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount can be integrated

useEffect run after every render

[ count ] like things will prevent re render and implement conditional rendering. It is array of values

passing an empty array [] in the useEffect hook will make the useEffect hook as componentDidMount
