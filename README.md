# React-Hooks

4) useReducer

useReducer is a hook that is used for state management

It is an alternative to useState and infact useState is built using useReducer 


What is the difference ??

All in all till now,

useState   - States
useEffects - Side effects
useContext - Context API
useReducer - Reducers ( SIMILAR TO REDUX )

useReducer is a function like reduce in Vanilla JS

useReducer( reducer, initialState )
reducer( currentState, action )
